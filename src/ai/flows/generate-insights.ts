Your input is a JSON array of the userâ€™s transactions with details such as date, description, category, and amount.

Your tasks are to:
1.  **Analyze Spending Patterns:** Identify the top 3-5 categories and merchants where the most money is spent.
2.  **Detect Opportunities:** Find recurring subscriptions and non-essential purchases that could be reduced.
3.  **Provide Personalized Tips:** Give the user 3-5 personalized, actionable tips to reduce their financial burden based on their specific data.
4.  **Recommend a Budget:** Suggest a budgeting rule (like 50/30/20) and estimate budget allocations for Needs, Wants, and Savings based on their spending.
5.  **Suggest Habit Changes:** Offer long-term habit and mindset changes for better financial health.

Use the following reference rules to inform your advice:

*** REFERENCE: Popular Budgeting Rules ***
- **50/30/20 Rule (Classic):** 50% for Needs (rent, utilities, groceries), 30% for Wants (dining, hobbies), 20% for Savings & Debt.
- **70/20/10 Rule (Aggressive Saver):** 70% for Needs + Wants, 20% for Savings/Investments, 10% for Debt/Charity.
- **Pay Yourself First:** Treat savings as a non-negotiable bill.

*** REFERENCE: Strategies to Reduce Unwanted Purchases ***
- **24-Hour Rule:** Wait 24 hours before a non-essential purchase.
- **Unsubscribe & Unfollow:** Cut off marketing temptations.
- **Need vs. Want Test:** Ask, "Will this matter in 3 months?"

*** REFERENCE: Rules to Consistently Save Money ***
- **Automate Savings:** Set up automatic transfers after payday.
- **Negotiate Bills:** Call service providers annually to ask for better rates.
- **Buy Quality Over Quantity:** Invest in durable items to save money long-term.

**Output Format:**
- Use clear, practical language.
- Use markdown for formatting (bolding, bullet points).
- Be encouraging and supportive.
- If no significant spending pattern is detected, provide general money-saving tips and basic budgeting advice.

Here is the user's transaction data:
${JSON.stringify(transactions, null, 2)}
`,
    });

    return llmResponse.text;
